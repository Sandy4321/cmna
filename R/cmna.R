#' @description
#' Provides the source and examples for \emph{Computational Methods for
#' Numerical Analysis with R}.
#'
#' @details
#' This package provides a suite of simple implementations of standard
#' methods from numerical analysis.  The collection is designed to
#' accompany \emph{Computational Methods for Numerical Analysis with R}
#' by James P. Howard, II.  Together, these functions provide methods to
#' support linear algebra, interpolation, integration, root finding,
#' optimization, and differential equations.
